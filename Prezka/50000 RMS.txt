ORIGINAL TEXT:
made with whole grains , and no trans - fats . 
i was glad they started making them in other " flavors " for variety . 
i 'm pretty sure i had bought a box of the roasted garlic at the grocery store when
they first came out and they were not so salty , and had a stronger garlic flavor , 
so i was disappointed with these . i guess if you love salt , and a milder garlic flavor , 
these are for you . note they have msg which is a migraine trigger for some people .
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
_ very salty _ eos _

ORIGINAL TEXT:
smooth for my taste . 
the most prominent flavor is that citric acid " kool - aid " taste , that fake tang after taste . 
there is barely , and i mean barely a hint of mint in there if you use your imagination . 
it 's almost like drinking " thick " water to me . 
that sounds odd i know , but it is very bland but with something in the background . 
i would definitely need a lot if rum to make this palatable . too bad . 
i really wanted to like it .
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
_ mild flavor _ eos _
MODEL PREDICTION:
_ good ! _ eos _

ORIGINAL TEXT:
says it is way better than the locally fresh roasted coffee he has been getting . 
every time he has a cup , he says " this is excellent coffee " . 
we 've been buying it for a year now and i 'm getting pretty tired of him saying that , but , he is right ! we ca n't use the 2 lbs up very fast so we freeze most of it in glass jars and just take it out and grind it each time we make it . 
it stays tasting great to the last bean !
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
super coffee ! _ eos _
MODEL PREDICTION:
_ delicious ! _ eos _

ORIGINAL TEXT:
few ( some coworkers and they loved it ! ! reminds me and them of when we were a kid . 
its the same thing . 3 different flavors . 
blue raspberry , cherry , and watermelon . 
the down side is i now have to buy more . 
the up side is its money well spent . 
these are the regular ones not the sour ones . 
which are listed on amazon . 
so be careful and always review the product carefully before purchasing . 
i almost made that mistake . which would n't be that bad .
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
! ! ! _ eos _
MODEL PREDICTION:
_ yum ! _ eos _


ORIGINAL TEXT:
it is n't over - steeped and allowed to turn bitter . 
( everyone has a strength preference and so you 'll have to experiment at first , 
but if you can keep it to no longer than 90 seconds , that should be ideal . ) further , 
if you have a water that allows you to select temperature , 
if you use a water temperature right below the boiling point , 
that smoothness can be extended further . an easy recommend to the tea lover , 
this tea is one of my favorites . five stars .

ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
