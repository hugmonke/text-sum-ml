ORIGINAL TEXT:
it tasted fine , but the dough fell during the final rise , so loaf came out and way too dense . 
i 'm pretty sure it was n't my error , as all you do is dump the flour mix over a cup of water , 
followed by a pre - measured pack of yeast on top , and run it on basic . 
the machine has always produced successful loaves , this one being the only exception thus far . 
i may give it another try , just to see if it was a bad batch .
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
failed

ORIGINAL TEXT:
a couple crumbs will fall off as i , but that 's okay for me , 
now that i know . a bit high in calories ( 180 ) , 
but the number of carbs is low ( 23 , before fiber content figures in ) , 
so it 's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar . 
it 's a darned tasty treat . i will look for them at my grocer 's in the near future , as the long school year gets . 
thanks , pamela !       
ORIGINAL SUMMARY:
