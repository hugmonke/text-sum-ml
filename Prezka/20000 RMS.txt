, and chances are i wo n't get the cold . if i am unable to head off the cold , 
this tea makes me feel better after one cup . 
the flavor is enjoyable , unlike some medicinal teas . i am unable to find this in 
stores near me , so i buy it in bulk ( 6 packs of 15 - count boxes ) , 
which is also a savings . i supply all of my friends and family with this healthy elixir . 
i recommend everyone try it when they are feeling under the weather .

ORIGINAL TEXT:
says it is way better than the locally fresh roasted coffee he has been getting . every time he has a cup , he says " this is excellent coffee " . we 've been buying it for a year now and i 'm getting pretty tired of him saying that , but , he is right ! we ca n't use the 2 lbs up very fast so we freeze most of it in glass jars and just take it out and grind it each time we make it . it stays tasting great to the last bean !
